The team project to build a clone of [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)
The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored
To see the fundamental background of the project visit the [wiki](https://github.com/ralexrivero/AirBnB_clone/wiki)
The console will perform the following tasks:
 - create a new object
 - retrive an object from a file
 - do operations on objects
 - destroy an object
**Storage**
All the classes are handled by the '''python
Storage ''' engine in the '''python FileStorage''' Class
